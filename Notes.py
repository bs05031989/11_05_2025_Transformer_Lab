üöÄ Excited to share something game-changing for anyone working with Large Language Models (LLMs): Transformer Lab ‚Äì a powerful, free, open-source app that puts full control of LLMs in your hands.

As a Techie, I've tested countless tools in the LLM space ‚Äì from LM Studio to Colab notebooks ‚Äì but nothing quite matches the flexibility and depth Transformer Lab offers.

üõ†Ô∏è With Transformer Lab, you can:

One-click download and run 100s of models like Llama 3, DeepSeek, Gemma, Mistral, and Phi-4.

Chat, prompt, and tweak responses in real-time.

Fine-tune and train models locally using Apple MLX, Hugging Face, and GPUs.

Leverage RLHF techniques like DPO, ORPO, and SIMPO.

Switch effortlessly between MLX, Hugging Face, and GGUF model formats.

Choose from multiple inference engines: vLLM, llama.cpp, and more.

Build datasets with a simple drag-and-drop UI.

Deploy models on your local machine or in the cloud.

Extend with built-in or custom plugins.

What really sets it apart? üß† Unlike LM Studio and similar tools, Transformer Lab goes beyond just chatting with models. You get true fine-tuning, dataset control, model conversion, and remote deployment. It‚Äôs a full-stack LLM playground for builders and researchers.

This is how LLM development should feel ‚Äî local, customizable, and powerful.

üîó If you're in AI, ML, or just LLM-curious, you‚Äôll want to give Transformer Lab a spin. It's open-source and community-driven ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just getting started.
